STRINGS
- Sequence of characters
- Small set
- Contiguous integer values for 'a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z' in both
    ASCII and UTF-16

In C++:
char:  ASCII
        8 bit
        Also supports wchar_t

In JAVA:
char:  UTF 16 (UNICODE standard format, the first 128 chars & their encoding are same as ASCII)(larger character set)
        16 bit
        Also supports byte


eg: char x='a';
    System.out.print((int)x);    //output=97
