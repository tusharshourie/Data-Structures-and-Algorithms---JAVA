Here, m-> pattern length
      n -> Text length1<=m<=n


* NAIVE = o((n-m+1)*m)              //no preprocessing
    naive when all characters of patterns are distinct = O(n)   

*RABIN KARP = O((n-m+1)*m)          //preprocessing pattern
            but better than NAIVE on average

* KMP = O(n)        //preprocessing pattern

*SUFFIX TREE = O(m)  //preprocessing text
