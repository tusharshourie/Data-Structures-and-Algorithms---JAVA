Greedy Technique= Problem solving Technique where we can make the locally optimum
        choice at each stage and hope to achieve a global optimum.

1. Optimisation= min, max

2. uses sorting

3. no fixed rule

4. not realised but used most of the times


Pros: Simple and Easy
Cons: A lot of time, global optimum not acheived
